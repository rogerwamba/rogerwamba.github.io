#  Hidden messages in DNA and my journey into Data Science and Machine Learning.

I have always been intrigued by research and publications on the Origins of Life.

In the Fall of 2014, I became interested in Apologetics with emphasis on Science and Spirituality. Little did I know, that course took me onto a very exciting and challenging journey on the study of Biological systems, Intelligent Design, evolutionary theories, including Darwinian and neo-Darwinian flavors.

As a result, I was led to undertake a formal course in Bioinformatics with the University of California, San Diego - USA, which I am still pursuing as of this January 2016.

As a Software Consultant and Developer, I discovered just how much Computer Science is needed to tackle some of the current pressing Biological challenges.

This in turn spiraled into my current interest and formal training in Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.

I dont know yet where it will lead, but it sure is an interesting journey.
